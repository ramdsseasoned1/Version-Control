# create two branches on remote ( where each branch is assigned to a developer/feature dev)
# to find all branches in repos
git remote show origin
# the above will tell you the new branches too

# the below will give the SHA1 codes for the remote
git ls-remote

# fetch remote new branches
git fetch

# to be able to push to a new branch use below command
git push origin Head:editor_1

# need to complete tracking; upstream; fork; training setup

#eod

# to create a new branch on repo, we can do it from local as well
git push origin editor_1_Local:editor_3

# The above code will create editor_3 in repo
# however the new branch error still exists "src refspec new_branch does not match any"

# delete a branch in remote
 git push --delete origin editor_2

# delete a branch in local
git branch -D editor_2
